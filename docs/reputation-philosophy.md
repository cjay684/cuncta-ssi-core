# CUNCTA Reputation ("Aura") Philosophy

## Principles

- Aura is domain-scoped capability credentials, not a universal mandatory score.
- No opaque secret scoring; users can understand what is presented.
- Users choose what to present; policies ask for capabilities, not raw scores.
- Remediation and appeal paths are required for any negative outcome.

## Anti-gaming commitments

- Counterparty diversity weighting is required.
- Diminishing returns for repeated counterparties.
- Anti-collusion down-weighting (no instant bans).

## Data minimization

- No PII stored; only pseudonymous identifiers and hashes.
- Evidence stored as hashes only.
