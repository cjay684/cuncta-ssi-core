# v1.0.0-testnet Security Hardening Release Notes

Release date: 2026-02-14  
Release type: Testnet hardening freeze  
Scope: Security posture uplift without SSI semantic changes or public API changes

## Included hardening changes

- Decoupled migrations from runtime startup path.
- Enforced least-privilege DB role checks by default in production.
- Disabled legacy service JWT fallback in production.
- Standardized service test-runner gating behavior.
- Hardened verifier status-list URL resolution to reduce SSRF exposure.
- Disabled public `/v1/issue` in production unless explicit dev mode.
- Required `MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL` in production migration execution.
- SHA-pinned GitHub Actions and enabled Dependabot updates for actions.
- Added self-hosted runner hardening and internal transport security runbooks.

## Explicit non-goals for this release

- No changes to SSI claim/verification semantics.
- No changes to public API contract shape.
- No change to Hedera network target (Testnet only).

## Verification evidence

Local verification snapshot (2026-02-14/16 session):

- Verification matrix commands:
  - `pnpm -r build`
  - `pnpm -r typecheck`
  - `pnpm -r test`
  - `RUN_TESTNET_INTEGRATION=1 pnpm verify:testnet` (manual/self-hosted only)

- `pnpm -r build`: pass
- `pnpm -r typecheck`: pass
- `pnpm -r test`: pass
- Manual Testnet verification: not run in default path (intentional; manual/self-hosted only)
- Security scanning jobs (audit/SAST/SBOM/container): TODO

## Operational notes

- Run migrations explicitly:

```bash
pnpm migrate
```

- Production migration command requires `MIGRATIONS_DATABASE_URL`.
- Runtime services should run with `AUTO_MIGRATE=false` in production.
- Public ingress should be through gateway; issuer internal endpoints remain service-auth protected.

## Rollback stance

- Prefer rollback by deployment artifact version, not by disabling security guards.
- Keep strict role and legacy-secret production guards enabled during rollback.

## Known non-blockers

- `web-demo` build emits third-party bundle size warnings and browser externalization warnings from upstream packages; these are informational and did not fail release verification.
