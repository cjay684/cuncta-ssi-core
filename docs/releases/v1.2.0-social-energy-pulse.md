# v1.2.0-testnet: Social Energy + Pulse

## Summary

- Social Energy v0.7: Hangout naming, Crews, Challenges, and Streaks.
- Pulse v0.8: Orb Pulse Panel, per-space pulse cards, and pulse preferences.

## Security Posture Preserved

- SSI invariants unchanged: SD-JWT, KB-JWT, pinning, floor checks, revocation, DSR, and anchoring semantics remain unchanged.
- No custodial keys introduced.
- User-pays remains first-class with no third-party payer dependency.
- SSRF and transport guardrails are preserved.
- Strict DB roles and migrations separation are preserved.

## Test Evidence

- `pnpm -r build` PASS
- `pnpm -r typecheck` PASS
- `pnpm -r test` PASS
- `RUN_TESTNET_INTEGRATION=1 SOCIAL_MODE=1 pnpm verify:testnet` PASS
- `RUN_TESTNET_INTEGRATION=1 SOCIAL_MODE=1 pnpm verify:testnet` passed twice back-to-back before tagging.

## Determinism Note

- Integration harness uses bounded, contract-observable readiness gates for Testnet eventual consistency (no semantic changes).
- Status-list failure assertion checks a fail-closed class of reasons (no semantic changes).
